This plugin is a plugin that shares the person who banned between the servers that have this plugin installed, and prevents the person who has a track record of vandalism from entering your server.

You can rest assured that Ban will be activated after the Japanese management team approves each application one by one!

Those who use this plugin are recommended to enter the GBans official server (URL: https://discord.gg/M3Jptu5).  If something goes wrong, we will accept reports and questions here, and we will also inform you here.

 "For example, let's say you have servers A, B, and C.
 A and B have introduced this plugin.
 C is not introduced.
 In this state, vandalism occurred on A's server.
 A's server turned out to be the culprit who trolled, so he globally banned X with this plugin.
 Mr. X no longer messed up A, so he tried to mess with B's server and accessed B's server, but it was saved because of this plugin.  Mr. X was also banned on server B when he was banned on server A.
 There was no choice, so Mr. X went to server C.
 I didn't have this plugin here, so I could easily troll it.
 And Server C has been damaged by vandalism ... "
 It plays a role in preventing such vandalism from entering another server and vandalizing one after another.
